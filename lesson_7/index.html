          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
          <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the

          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabilities.
          With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
          as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
          React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn
          more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
          components work in React Native.

          React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for
          building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React
          Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
          started or can serve as a refresher course. <br /><br />

          We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          <br /><br />
          <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
          in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and
          a cafe to work in. <br /><br />
          <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
          write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <code>&#60;Text&#62;</code> Hello, I am your cat!
          <code>&#60;/Text&#62;</code>. The React docs have a comprehensive
          guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
          JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
          name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
          <code>&#60;Text&#62;</code>.

          <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.

          <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal
          data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
          or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
          memory!
        </p>
        <span class="border_for_main" id="handling_text_input"></span>
        <p class="main_title">HANDLING TEXT INPUT</p>
        <p class="main_paragraph_text">
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time
          the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
          be called when the text is submitted. For example, let's say that as
          the user types, you're translating their words into a different
          language. In this new language, every single word is written the same
          way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as
          "üçïüçïüçï".
